### Deck Sharing

If you are bored playing holy_sheep_legacy, this is another game develped in a rush in basically 1 day sprint during the yearly stages of Covid-19.
Same logic as holy_sheep, you install the dependencies, run everything on an accessible machine, such as a Raspberry PI, allow your friends to connect to it and play.
In this case you have two possible team to insert "blue" or "orange", there is also an administrator, called "host".
One of you should be the host, the others must split between orange and blue team. The game is a copy of Family Fued, you already now how it goes...
